This article lays down the path, that you should follow in order to learn DP.

1. Check out DP Tutorials online. I would recommend you to check out these videos from [MIT OCw on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ5jsbhAv_M&list=PLfMspJ0TLR5HRFu2kLh3U4mvStMO8QURm)

2. After checking out the videos, read up on Dynamic Programming from [Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.flipkart.com/introduction-algorithms-english-3rd/p/itmdwxyrafdburzg?pid=9788120340077&ref=L%3A7421940843089576388&srno=p_3&query=cormen&otracker=from-search). 

3. Solve [KNAPSACK SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/KNAPSACK/).

4. Another easy [problem on SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/MISERMAN/)

5. For more problems and tutorials, check out, [Codechef: List of DS and Algo tutorials](https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/48877/data-structures-and-algorithms).
