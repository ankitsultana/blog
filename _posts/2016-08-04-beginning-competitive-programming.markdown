I have been asked a lot on how to get started with competitive programming, so I decided to write
this post, so I could point to this post whenever anyone asks me the same question again.

### Which Language to choose

I would strongly recommend C++. Don't use C, because C++ has in built support for various
algorithms and data structures, which C lacks.

You can also use Java if you are familiar with the same.

But since C++ is used by the majority of competitive programmers, I'd recommend the same.

### How to Begin

What follows is my personal opinion.

###### Stage 1 | Getting Familiar

Initially you should focus on getting comfortable with the programming contests environment
and work on being able to quickly convert rudimentary ideas to code.

For that, I would recommend doing Codeforces Division 2 Contests' A problems. Do like 10-20 of these,
till you can solve them in less than 15 minutes on average.

Note that for doing some of these, you may have to learn some basic things like calculating
gcd/lcm etc.

You can also try this [list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bk2dcradle/algorithms-practice/master/Problems-Level-1.txt) of easy problems on SPOJ I made a long time ago.

For every problem, if you are not able to solve it, search online for solutions (in case of SPOJ)
or look at the editorial (in case of Codeforces).

For every problem, you should spend somewhere around 40-60 minutes thinking about the solution,
and another 40-60 minutes coding it.

Also start Codechef's long contests. The first 2/3 problems are generally easy enough that a beginner
can solve them. You can also try upsolving (solving a problem after the contest has ended,
either by referring the editorial or otherwise) the problems that you were not able to solve during
the contest.

Also get familiar with C++'s [map](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/map/), [set](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/set/) and [vector](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/vector/).

Read [this](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/) article for learning a bit about C++ STL
(Standard Template Library).

Here are some problems which use C++ STL,

###### Stage 2 | Learning Basic Algorithms

Now that you are familiar with the environment, time to learn some basic algorithms.

I'd recommend you the following:

1. Sieve of Eratosthenes
2. Depth First Search (DFS)
3. Breadth First Search (BFS)
4. Binary Search
5. Dynamic Programming (DP)

You can find tutorials for most of these by googling online.

For DFS and BFS, you can try problems from [here](http://ankitsultana.com/blog/2016/01/12/Easy-Graph-Problems/)

For Binary Search, you can find links to problems and tutorial [here](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/cpsig/tree/master/binary_search)

I wrote another post telling how to go about learning DP. You can find it [here](http://ankitsultana.com/blog/2016/02/21/dp-resources/)
