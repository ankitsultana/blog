There is one question that I get asked more often than not.

> How do I start with Dynamic Programming ?

So I had to write this.

This is a list that should help you get familiar with Dynamic Programming. Note that the order is important.

1. Check out DP Tutorials online. I would recommend you to check out these videos from [MIT OCw on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ5jsbhAv_M&list=PLfMspJ0TLR5HRFu2kLh3U4mvStMO8QURm)

2. Read up on Dynamic Programming on [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/)

3. Solve [KNAPSACK SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/KNAPSACK/). Note that at least one of the above explain Knapsack.

4. Solve more easy problems. You can try [COINS - SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/COINS/), [BYTESM2 - SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/BYTESM2/), [PARTY - SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/PARTY/), [MIXTURES - SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/MIXTURES/), [PIGBANK - SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/problems/PIGBANK/).

4. Read more on Dynamic Programming from [Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.flipkart.com/introduction-algorithms-english-3rd/p/itmdwxyrafdburzg?pid=9788120340077&ref=L%3A7421940843089576388&srno=p_3&query=cormen&otracker=from-search).

5. Learn to use DP with bitmasks [here](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/337)

At the end, I would recommend you to explore [Mimino](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michal-Danil%C3%A1k) 's answers on Quora.

Always remember, solving problems is the key to truly understand DP.
